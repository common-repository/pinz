Pinz : Place any post/page anywhere on your site, regardless of any theme !

== Description ==

Pinz is a simple way to pin/place any kind of post or page anywhere on your website.

One great plus of Pinz is that it works on any theme !

- Think for a second that you want to place a contact form ‘here’, directly on your hompage.
But with the specific theme you are using, you just can’t. You will have to go into the code...  (argh!!)
- Or maybe, you want to put a temporary message on you website. Let’s say, at the end of all your post/page. 
Or maybe at the top you website... well... 

In other words, Pinz allows you to bypass all themes limits and keep it simple !
